# Aocli

This is my home-made CLI to work on Advent of Code's puzzles.

This repository does not contains the puzzles text nor the puzzles inputs, as stated by the creator in his [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).
> *If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.*

## Usage

Solving a puzzle
```bash
python cli/main.py solve --year 2022 --day 8 --phase 2
```

Generate the folder structure and the files for the given year
```bash
python cli/main.py generate --year 2023
```
